# k8s Fundamentals Labs

While these labs should work on any k8s cluster, the directions are designed for the VMware Enterprise PKS lab environment. 

If working on another k8s cluster, references to cli-vm would be your workstation with kubectl installed and the persistent storage lab may require some modification if the k8s cluster is not running on an esxi host (This is due to the storage provider specification.).

The intent of these labs is to provide a basic introduction of k8s concepts.
