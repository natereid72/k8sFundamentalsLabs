# k8s Fundamentals Labs

This set of labs should work on any k8s cluster, the persistent storage lab would require some modification if the k8s cluster is not running on an esxi host. This is due to the storage provider specification.

The intent of these labs is to provide a basic introduction of k8s concepts.
