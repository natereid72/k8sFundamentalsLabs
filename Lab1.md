Lab 1 - Explore Cluster Namespaces with kubectl
------

1. From CLI-VM, execute `kubectl get ns`
2. Execute `kubectl describe ns default`

You should see that there are four namespaces and the default namespace has no resource quutas or limits set.

This is the end of lab 1. You performed a basic kubectl get command and retrieved information about namespaces in the cluster.
